## robot-dynamics-mynotes

Below are some small experiments related to dynamics. Unfortunately, a **substantial** amount of code I wrote (kinematics, simulation, physical control) cannot be made public, because the lab I used to work will continue to conduct related research. 

The motor cannot be moved by hand by default and can only control current or position. 
However, by utilizing sensors embedded within the motor and some knowledge of dynamics, human-machine interaction features can be achieved. 
These properties can be utilized for the legs of mobile robots to increase their robustness.
